         <p> falooda is an Indian version of a cold dessert made with noodles. [1][2] It has origins in the Persian dish faloodeh, variants of which are found across West, Central, and South Asia.[3] Traditionally it is made by mixing rose syrup, vermicelli, and sweet basil seeds with milk, often served with ice cream.[4] The vermicelli used for preparing falooda is made from wheat,[5] arrowroot, cornstarch, or sago.[6]

            The origin of falooda goes back to Iran (Persia), where a similar dessert, faloodeh, was popular.[7] The dessert came to Medieval India with the many Central Asian dynasties that invaded and settled in the Indian subcontinent in the 16th to 18th century.[7] The present form of falooda was developed in the Mughal Empire and spread with its conquests. The Persianate rulers who succeeded from the Mughals patronized the dessert with their own adaptations, specifically in Hyderabad Deccan and the Carnatic areas of present-day India.[2] This dessert is now a major part of Pakistani and Bangladeshi culture, specially served on Islamic holidays, weddings and other occasions. It is also a well known part of Sri Lankan modern culture.</p>
